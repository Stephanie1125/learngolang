* Imagine we're making an email program that stores an Address Book
  for users that can be used to store, lookup, and delete contact
  information for the user.

* There's a lot of data structures that could work well for this.

* In this starter code there's an interface for an AddressBook.

* Make an implementation for this interface that passes the tests
  provided.

* Once that's working, try making faster implementations!
